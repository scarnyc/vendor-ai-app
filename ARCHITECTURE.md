# Architecture

## One-paragraph summary

A single Next.js 16 app deployed on Vercel. The frontend is a canvas-first
workbench (React 19 + Tailwind 4) that talks to four endpoints under
`/api/`. The two write endpoints (`POST /api/run/[case]`, `POST /api/resume`)
return **AG-UI events over Server-Sent Events** so the operator sees tool
audit cards stream in one-by-one rather than waiting for a single 2-minute
JSON blob. Those endpoints drive a LangGraph.js state machine — 14 nodes that
mirror the spec's PNG flow — and surface the agent's output as a structured
`DecisionPacket`. A human approval interrupt sits between packet assembly and
the final emit; nothing leaves the agent without an operator click. The whole
TypeScript stack is intentional: it collapses to one Vercel deploy and lets the
state schema, the API contract, the SSE event vocabulary, and the React props
all share a single Zod source of truth.

One structural change vs. the spec's original PNG (DESIGN §16.7):

1. **`await_run` initial state** — the operator's Run button issues
   `Command({ resume: "run" })` to get past it. This stops the graph from
   auto-running on every cold-start of a fresh thread.

An edit-and-re-run loop-back from `human_approval` to
`classify_data_sensitivity` was scoped but deferred — `postHumanRouter`
currently always routes to `emit_final`. The operator's "Edit & re-run"
affordance is tracked in `PRODUCTIONIZATION.md` ("Operator 'Edit'
affordance — deferred"). The schema reserves no state for it; if/when
it lands it will re-run only the LLM-driven downstream nodes and reuse
the cached deterministic tool outputs.

`validate_citations` runs after packet assembly and before the human gate. It
substring-checks every `PolicyCitation.quote` against the cited policy file.
Failures get demoted to `severity: "warn"` and an `agent_citation_unverified`
flag is appended. This closes the no-hallucination loop.

## API surface

| Method | Path | Response | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/run/[case]` | **SSE event stream** | Seed thread + drive the graph until it pauses at the HITL gate. Streams AG-UI events; closes on `RUN_PAUSED_AWAITING_HUMAN`. Idempotent: a re-POST on an already-paused thread replays the cached event stream from the in-memory checkpoint. |
| GET | `/api/run/[case]` | JSON snapshot | Snapshot current thread state without advancing. Used for case-tab rehydration. |
| POST | `/api/resume` | **SSE event stream** | Resume a thread stopped at the human approval interrupt. Body: `{ case_id, decision: HumanDecision }`. Streams `RUN_RESUMED → STATE_DELTA(human_decision) → RUN_FINISHED`. |
| GET | `/api/policy/[doc]` | JSON | Verbatim policy text + section index for the policy drawer. |

The two SSE endpoints both pin `runtime = 'nodejs'` and
`dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` so Vercel doesn't buffer chunks. They share a
single async-generator core (`src/lib/agent/stream.ts: streamRun`) that emits
typed events — the route handlers are thin transport wrappers around it,
which also makes the streaming tests trivial (no HTTP needed).

**`thread_id === case_id`** — one MemorySaver thread per case; case tabs in the
UI map directly to thread persistence. URL-keyed thread restoration survives
Vercel cold-start within a single warm container.

## AG-UI event protocol

The SSE endpoints stream events drawn from the AG-UI event vocabulary
(typed builders in `src/lib/agent/events.ts`, parsed against `AgUiEventSchema`
on the client for defense-in-depth). No CopilotKit runtime — just the
vocabulary, hand-rolled over SSE.

| Event | Carries | When |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN_STARTED` | `case_id`, `thread_id`, `provider` | First frame of `/api/run`. |
| `TOOL_CALL_START` | `tool_name`, `args` | Synthesized before each deterministic-tool node executes (via `NODE_TOOL_MAP`). |
| `TOOL_CALL_END` | `tool_name`, `result`, `duration_ms` | After each tool's `tools_called[]` record lands. |
| `STATE_DELTA` | `path: string[]`, `value` | Incremental state writes. `path` is an array of keys; `'-'` means array-append. |
| `STATE_SNAPSHOT` | `decision_packet` | Fires **exactly once**, post-`validate_citations`. The "packet now safe to render" semaphore that gates `DecisionPacketCard`. |
| `RUN_PAUSED_AWAITING_HUMAN` | *(no body)* | Terminal frame of `/api/run` when the graph hits `humanApprovalNode`. Deliberately *not* `RUN_FINISHED` — the event name keeps the §9 boundary structurally legible. |
| `RUN_RESUMED` | `human_decision` | First frame of `/api/resume`. |
| `RUN_FINISHED` | `final_state` | Terminal frame of `/api/resume` once `emit_final` runs. |
| `RUN_ERROR` | `code`, `message`, `recoverable` | Any unhandled error; the client surfaces a Retry affordance for recoverable codes. |

The reducer's source of truth is the `STATE_DELTA` stream;
`STATE_SNAPSHOT` is a one-shot render gate, not a state-rebuild source.
Server emits events through typed builders (`events.runStarted(...)`
etc.); client parses each frame with `AgUiEventSchema.parse()`, so
schema drift surfaces as a Zod error rather than a silent UI hang.

The HITL pause closes the stream on the server side; the client opens a
*new* SSE stream against `/api/resume` once the operator clicks. No
keepalive on an idling interrupt — fewer Vercel function-minutes burned
sitting on a paused graph.

## Schema (Zod)

`src/lib/agent/schemas.ts` is the single source of truth. Highlights:

- **`PolicyCitation`** — `policy_doc` (enum of 7), `section`, `quote` (≤200 chars),
  `verified: boolean` (set by `validate_citations`).
- **`PolicyFlag`** — `severity` (info | warn | block), `issue`, `recipient` (which
  approver this routes to), and at least one citation.
- **`DecisionPacket`** — case_id, intake summary, missing items, risk tier,
  data class, budget check, TCV, duplicate check, flags, required approvers,
  recommended action (`approve_with_followup` | `escalate` | `block`),
  optional vendor draft (clearly DRAFT), internal ticket draft, audit trail of
  tool calls, optional `human_decision` (set after HITL).
- **`HumanDecision`** — `verdict` (approved | rejected | escalated | follow_up), notes,
  decided_at/by, optional `edits_applied`. The 4th state (`follow_up`) covers
  the most-common case-folder shape: vendor isn't bad, paperwork isn't done.
  See `PRODUCTIONIZATION.md` "The Grey Area" for why a 3-state model forced
  this decision into either premature-Approve or overstated-Reject.

The schema deliberately has **no field that can express "approved by the
agent"** or **"sent to vendor"**. Approval lives only on `human_decision`,
which the agent cannot write itself (only the `humanApprovalNode` consumes the
resume value). Vendor email is always `draft_vendor_email`, never "sent_email".

## Frontend

The workbench is one page, three logical zones:

1. **Canvas header** — vendor name, ACV, run status, provider chip.
2. **Case tabs** — case_001 / case_002 / case_003 pills drive `?case=00N`
   deep links and per-case state via React state keyed by case_id.
3. **Canvas body** — streams top-down as the agent runs: PlanList →
   ToolAuditCard stack → DecisionPacketCard (the artifact) →
   ConfirmationCard (HITL inline, operator-only).

`Workbench.tsx` is the only stateful component, and its single source of
state is the `useStreamingRun(caseId)` hook (`src/hooks/useStreamingRun.ts`).
The hook owns the SSE lifecycle: GETs `/api/run/[case]` on mount for
rehydration, opens the SSE POST stream behind an `AbortController`,
runs a small reducer that turns each AG-UI event into `AgentState` shape,
and surfaces a `phase` ('idle' | 'countdown' | 'streaming' | 'paused' |
'finished' | 'error') the components key off. Children are pure
presentational (props in, callbacks out). A module-scoped in-flight set
dedupes by `case_id` so React 19 strict-mode's double-mount can't fire
two paid POSTs per arrival.

The first arrival to a case in a session arms the §5.2 3-second
countdown card via the same hook; cancelling reverts to the static
`▶ Run agent` button (§5.4). Return visits to a case whose state is
still in `MemorySaver` rehydrate instantly with no countdown.

The workbench is operator-only (Procurement) by deliberate scope; the ambient
prompt pill (bottom-of-canvas slash-command input) was likewise removed before
the v0.10 cycle — neither changed the operator's decision path. The
recipient-lens preview views (filtered renders for Legal, Security, CFO, etc.)
are deferred per `PRODUCTIONIZATION.md` "Recipient-lens preview views —
deferred"; the canvas IS the artifact view today.

## HITL pattern

Inside `humanApprovalNode` (in `nodes.ts`):

```typescript
const verdict = interrupt({
  type: 'human_approval_required',
  case_id: state.case_id,
  decision_packet: state.decision_packet,
}) as HumanDecision;
```

`interrupt()` pauses the graph; the next `graph.invoke(new Command({ resume: X }))`
returns `X` as the value of that call. `/api/resume` accepts the operator's
verdict, casts it to `HumanDecision`, and the graph routes via `postHumanRouter`
to `emit_final` — the router is a constant returner today; all four verdicts
(`approved`, `rejected`, `escalated`, `follow_up`) terminate at `emit_final` (see
`nodes.ts:postHumanRouter` and the `addConditionalEdges('human_approval', …)`
binding in `graph.ts`). The edit-and-re-run loop-back back through
`classify_data_sensitivity` is documented as deferred (`PRODUCTIONIZATION.md`
"Operator 'Edit' affordance — deferred"). One small idempotency wart:
`/api/run` checks `(existing.next ?? []).length > 0` and no-ops on re-POST so a
stray `/run case_xxx` doesn't inject `'run'` into an already-active interrupt.

## LLM provider switch

`activeProvider()` reads `LLM_PROVIDER`. Five modes:

- **`mock`** — graph nodes branch on `activeProvider() === 'mock'` and pull
  responses from `mocks.ts` keyed by `case_id`. No network, deterministic,
  free. Used for dev/CI/PRs. Default when `LLM_PROVIDER` is unset.
- **`anthropic`** *(recommended for production demo)* — Anthropic Claude
  Sonnet 4.6 with adaptive extended thinking via native Structured Outputs
  (`withStructuredOutput(schema, { method: 'jsonSchema' })`). When
  `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is also set, a hand-rolled `composeWithFallback` wraps
  the primary against a DeepSeek backup — catches Anthropic rate-limits,
  spend-cap 429s, or transient 5xx without changing config.
- **`anthropic-only`** — Anthropic, no fallback. Used by `pnpm eval:dataset`
  so eval failures surface as eval failures, not silently masked by a
  weaker fallback.
- **`deepseek-only`** — DeepSeek only, no fallback (`deepseek-chat`
  default, `https://api.deepseek.com`). Cost lane; legacy aliases
  `deepseek` and `deepseek-direct` map here.
- **`openrouter`** — `ChatOpenAI` pointed at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
  with `:free` models by default (`deepseek/deepseek-chat:free`, override via
  `OPENROUTER_MODEL`). Keyless escape hatch — rate-limited under load and
  subject to the Vercel 10s function timeout on cold queues.

The Anthropic→DeepSeek composer (`composeWithFallback` in `llm.ts`) catches
both transport errors and `LlmStructuredOutputError` (a Zod-refinement
failure on the grammar-constrained output) and emits a structured
`llm.fallback.fired` JSON log so the signal is queryable in LangSmith /
Vercel log aggregation.

Caller-side responsibility: `MockChatModel.invoke()` throws loudly so any node
that forgets to short-circuit on mock mode fails fast instead of silently
hitting the network.

The single LLM call site is `runLlmComposition` in `nodes.ts:777` — it
composes the five narrative fields of the `DecisionPacket` (intake summary,
policy flags with citations, recommended action, draft internal ticket,
vendor follow-up draft) from the deterministic facts the tools already
gathered. Citations are then verbatim-checked by `validate_citations` before
the human gate, so a fallback model with weaker quoting just produces more
`agent_citation_unverified` warn flags — never silent hallucinations.

## Hard product lines (SPEC §9 — where they're enforced)

| Constraint | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Agent never approves spend | Schema has no agent-writable approval field; `human_decision` is only written by `humanApprovalNode` from the resume value. |
| Agent never sends external messages | Vendor email is `draft_vendor_email`. UI button is "Copy draft", not "Send". No SMTP, no mailto, no integration. |
| Agent never accepts contract language | No `contract_modifications` or `accepted_terms` field exists. Contract PDF is read-only input. |
| Agent never makes the final security/privacy decision | Security flags route to `recipient: "security"` and require human approver acknowledgment. The packet's `recommended_action` is a *recommendation*, not a decision. |

## Constraints from Vercel

- **10s function timeout** (Hobby tier) — all LLM calls stream so the timer
  resets per chunk. Worst case is a `:free` OpenRouter model under load; mock
  mode is the safety lane.
- **Ephemeral filesystem** — no SqliteSaver; we use `MemorySaver`. In-flight
  HITL state is lost on cold start. Documented as acceptable for a demo;
  productionization note covers the Postgres-backed checkpointer swap.

## Tracing (P1, optional)

Set `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` + `LANGSMITH_PROJECT=vendor-triage`. Every node + tool
call appears in the LangSmith dashboard. Free observability for the reviewer.

## Fixture surfaces

Two case-shaped fixture surfaces sit side by side and are intentionally
hand-synced for the prototype. `src/lib/cases.ts` is a UI-only metadata
fixture — `vendor_name`, `short_name`, `acv_short`, `one_liner` — consumed by
the case-tab strip and canvas header so the operator can scan the queue
without invoking the agent. It is *not* ground truth: the agent never reads
it. Ground truth lives under `cases/<id>/` (`intake_xlsx`, `vendor_email_txt`,
`quote_csv`, `security_questionnaire_md`, `contract_pdf`) and is the only
input `parse_inputs` sees. The two are kept in sync by hand for the three
demo cases; production swap is a Workday / NetSuite vendor read against the
real vendor master, which removes the hand-sync entirely.
